## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
2. For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Keep changes focused and atomic

### Development Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow Go conventions and best practices
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes:**

   go build -o auto-spotify
   ./auto-spotify "test with your changes"
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- **Add:** for new features

- **Docs:** for documentation changes

Examples:
- `Add: support for custom playlist descriptions`
